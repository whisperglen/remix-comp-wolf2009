</div>

## Overview
This repository contains a compatibility mod that enables NVIDIA RTX Remix support for Halo: Combat Evolved.  
It is built on top of xoxor4d's RTX Remix Compatibility Codebase.

#### It features:
- A hooked D3D9 interface, with every function detoured for easy access and interception
- Logic to aid with drawcall modifications
- A basic ImGui menu for debugging purposes

<br>

## Installation
1. Rename the RTX Remix `d3d9.dll` to `d3d9_remix.dll` in your Halo CE game directory.
2. Compile the mod (see below) — it will generate a `d3d9.dll` for you to use as the proxy.
3. Place the generated `d3d9.dll` into your Halo CE game directory alongside `d3d9_remix.dll`.
4. Launch the game with the `-window` flag to enable borderless fullscreen (e.g. `haloce.exe -window`).

<br>

## Compiling
- Clone the repository `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/halo-rtx-compat.git`
- Install [VS 2022 Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
  (the full VS 2022 IDE works too). Select the **Desktop development with C++** workload.
- Optional: set environment variable `REMIX_COMP_ROOT` to your game folder and `REMIX_COMP_ROOT_EXE` to the exe name.
- Run `build.bat` — it compiles everything directly with `cl.exe` and produces `build\bin\Release\d3d9.dll`.
  - Pass `debug` as an argument for a debug build: `build.bat debug`
- Copy everything inside the `assets` folder into the game directory.
