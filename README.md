# Overview
This repository contains a compatibility mod that enables NVIDIA RTX Remix support for Halo: Combat Evolved.  
It is built on top of xoxor4d's RTX Remix Compatibility Codebase.

#### It features:
- A hooked D3D9 interface, with every function detoured for easy access and interception
- Logic to aid with drawcall modifications
- A basic ImGui menu for debugging purposes

## Documentation / Guides
Please see: https://github.com/xoxor4d/remix-comp-base/tree/master/documentation
<br>

## Installation
1. Rename the RTX Remix `d3d9.dll` to `d3d9_remix.dll` in your Halo CE game directory.
2. Compile the mod (see below) — it will generate a `d3d9.dll` for you to use as the proxy.
3. Place the generated `d3d9.dll` into your Halo CE game directory alongside `d3d9_remix.dll`.

<br>

## Compiling
- Clone the repository `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/halo-rtx-compat.git`
- Optional: Setup a global path variable named `REMIX_COMP_ROOT` that points to your game folder
  & `REMIX_COMP_ROOT_EXE` which includes the exe name of your game.
- Run `generate-buildfiles_vs22.bat` to generate VS project files
- Compile the mod — a `d3d9.dll` proxy will be generated for you.
- Copy everything inside the `assets` folder into the game directory.
